# Problem 1. Gated Recurrent Unit

-Implement a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in Python using numpy.
-Given a sequence of inputs and corresponding hidden states, the GRU should compute the output hidden states at each time step using the equations pro- vided above.
-Implement a function that takes in the input sequence inputs, initial hidden state h_prev, and the weight matrices Wz, Uz, Wr, Ur, W, and U as inputs and returns the sequence of hidden states.
-The GRU should use sigmoid as the activation function for the update and reset gates, and tanh as the activation function for the candidate hidden state.
# Problem 2. Long Short-Term Memory


• Implement a LSTM cell in Python using the equations provided in the lecture. • Create a LSTM network with one LSTM cell and pass a sequence of random input data through it. • Print the output hidden state h and memory cell c at each time step.
